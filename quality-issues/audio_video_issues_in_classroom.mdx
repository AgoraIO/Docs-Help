### How to adjust video resolution?

#### Video resolution in class

The Web side `launch` can `launchOption.MediaOptions` adjust the resolution in the class by changing the parameter in the method:

- `launchOption.MediaOptions.lowStreamCameraEncoderConfiguration` Used to adjust the resolution of small streams
- `launchOption.mediaOptions.cameraEncoderConfiguration` Used to adjust the resolution of large streams
- `launchOption.mediaOptions.screenShareEncoderConfiguration` Used to adjust the resolution of screen sharing

The following sample code illustrates how to modify the resolution of small and large streams:

```
    AgoraEduSDK.launch(appRef.current, {
        ...launchOption,
        recordUrl,
        courseWareList,
        uiMode: homeStore.theme,
        virtualBackgroundImages,
        virtualBackgroundVideos,
        mediaOptions: {
        cameraEncoderConfiguration: {
            width: 1280,
            height: 720,
            frameRate: 30,
            bitrate: 1710,
        },
        lowStreamCameraEncoderConfiguration:{
            width: 1280,
            height: 720,
            frameRate: 30,
            bitrate: 1710,
        }
        },
        listener: (evt: AgoraEduClassroomEvent, type) => {
        ,
    });
```

### Recording video resolution

On the web side, you can adjust the resolution of class recording videos by changing the parameters in the recording status of the RESTful API settings, refer to the following sample code: `webRecordConfig`

```
get recordArgs() {
const { recordUrl, rteEngineConfig, recordRetryTimeout } = EduClassroomConfig.shared;
const args = {
    webRecordConfig: {
    rootUrl: `${recordUrl}?language=${rteEngineConfig.language}`,
        videoBitrate: 3000,
        videoWidth：1280,
        videoHeight:720,
        videoFps:15
    },
    mode: RecordMode.Web,
    retryTimeout: recordRetryTimeout,
};
```

### When using screen sharing, the error "Please enable screen recording permission first" is reported?

If you encounter the following error when you enable screen sharing, it means that you have not enabled the system screen recording permission.

Taking the macOS system as an example, you can enable the corresponding permission in System Settings > Privacy and Security > Screen Recording.

### Is there any network bandwidth requirement for live streaming?

- Bandwidth and speed of the teacher terminal: Exclusive broadband of 10 Mbps or more, and the uplink speed is greater than 4 Mbps.
- Bandwidth and speed of student terminal: Exclusive broadband with a minimum of 4 Mbps or more.

### What should I do if I get stuck frequently during class, can’t hear the audio clearly, have a white or black screen, or fail to load courseware?

If you have the above network problems, please refer to the following steps to check your network:

- Restart the router and reconnect to the network.
- The device is close to the router, not separated by a wall.
- Disconnect other programs or devices that occupy the network speed, such as download programs, online playback programs, cloud disk software, TV network set-top boxes, etc.
- Switch networks, such as switching from WiFi to 4G hotspot network and re-enter the classroom.
- Reboot the device.
- Turn off VPN or web proxy.

### What if the students can't hear the teacher's voice?
- Check whether the teacher's microphone is turned on.
- Check the student network status.
- Check that the Student speakers (including volume mixers) and browser are muted.
- Check whether the speaker device used in the class on the student side is selected correctly.
- Students exit and re-enter the classroom or restart the device.

### What should I do if the teacher cannot hear the students?
- Check that the student is on stage and has the microphone turned on.
- Check that the teacher's speakers (including volume mixer) and browser are muted.
- Check whether the speaker equipment used in the teacher's class is selected correctly.
- The teacher exits and re-enters the classroom or restarts the device.
