### Why can't I turn on the camera or microphone in the web client?

Check your browser's permission to use your camera and microphone. If the permissions are granted but the camera or microphone still
don't work, take the following steps:

1. Clear your browser cache
1. Restart the browser
1. Update your browser

### How to adjust the video resolution?

#### Video resolution in a classroom

Use `launchOption.MediaOptions` configurations of the web client to adjust the resolution in a classroom:

- `launchOption.MediaOptions.lowStreamCameraEncoderConfiguration`: Adjust the small stream resolution.
- `launchOption.mediaOptions.cameraEncoderConfiguration`: Adjust the large stream resolution.
- `launchOption.mediaOptions.screenShareEncoderConfiguration`: Adjust the screen sharing resolution.

The following sample code illustrates how to modify the resolution of small and large streams:

``` typescript
    AgoraEduSDK.launch(appRef.current, {
        ...launchOption,
        recordUrl,
        courseWareList,
        uiMode: homeStore.theme,
        virtualBackgroundImages,
        virtualBackgroundVideos,
        mediaOptions: {
        cameraEncoderConfiguration: {
            width: 1280,
            height: 720,
            frameRate: 30,
            bitrate: 1710,
        },
        lowStreamCameraEncoderConfiguration:{
            width: 1280,
            height: 720,
            frameRate: 30,
            bitrate: 1710,
        }
        },
        listener: (evt: AgoraEduClassroomEvent, type) => {
        ,
    });
```

#### Recording video resolution

Adjust the resolution of class recordings in the web client by changing the recording state parameters in RESTful API, specifically `webRecordConfig`:

```typescript
get recordArgs() {
const { recordUrl, rteEngineConfig, recordRetryTimeout } = EduClassroomConfig.shared;
const args = {
    webRecordConfig: {
    rootUrl: `${recordUrl}?language=${rteEngineConfig.language}`,
        videoBitrate: 3000,
        videoWidth：1280,
        videoHeight:720,
        videoFps:15
    },
    mode: RecordMode.Web,
    retryTimeout: recordRetryTimeout,
};
```

### When using screen sharing, the error 'Please enable screen recording permission first' is reported.

If you encounter this error when you enable screen sharing, it means that you have not granted the screen recording permission.

Taking the macOS system as an example, you can enable the corresponding permission in **System Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Screen Recording**.

### Are there any specific network bandwidth requirements for live streaming?

- Teacher's device: Exclusive broadband and uplink speed of at least 10 Mbps and 4 Mbps, respectively.
- Student's device: Exclusive broadband of at least 4 Mbps.

### What should a user do if they get stuck frequently during class, can’t hear the audio clearly, have a white or black screen, or fail to load courseware?

If a user has the above network problems, they should take the following steps to check their network:

- Restart the router and reconnect to the network.
- Move the device away from the router, make sure it is separated by a wall.
- Turn off other programs and disconnect devices that occupy the network speed, such as download programs, online playback programs, cloud disk software, TV network set-top boxes, or others.
- Switch networks, for example, switch from WiFi to a 4G hotspot and re-enter the classroom.
- Reboot the device.
- Turn off VPN or web proxy.

### What if the students can't hear the teacher's voice?

The teacher should:
- Check whether their microphone is turned on.

The students should:
- Check their network status.
- Check that their speakers, including the volume mixer, and browsers are muted.
- Check whether their speaker devices have been selected correctly.
- Exit and re-enter the classroom or restart the device.

### What if the teacher cannot hear the students?

The student should:
- Check that they are on stage and have their microphone turned on.

The teacher should:
- Check that their speakers, including the volume mixer, and browser are muted.
- Check whether their speaker device is selected correctly.
- Exit and re-enter the classroom or restart the device.
