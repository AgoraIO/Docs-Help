Blurry videos may be caused by low bitrates and resolution ratios.

## Step 1: Self-check

Check the following:

1. Check `videoProfile`. If possible, set `videoProfile` to a higher level to see whether the video is clearer.
1. Check the stream type of the receiver. If the stream type is low, call the `setRemoteVideoStreamType` method to switch from a low stream to high stream.
1. Switch to 4G or another Wi-Fi network to ensure that the blurry video is not caused by poor Internet connections.
1. Turn off all pre-processing options.

## Step 2: Contact Agora Customer Support

If the issue persists, contact Agora customer support and submit the issue with the following information:

1. The uid of the user who sees the blurry video.
1. The time frame during which the blurry video appears.
1. SDK logs and screen recording files of the user.
