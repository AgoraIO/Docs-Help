There are many reasons for a camera start failure. Check the following:

- Check if the camera access permission is enabled. Both Android and iOS systems have a runtime access permission function under System Settings. Additionally, security software on Android may control camera access permissions.
- Check if another application is using the camera. Close all applications, restart your phone, and try again.
- Check the camera hardware. Start the built-in video camera to test the recording function.
