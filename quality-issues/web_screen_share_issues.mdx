## Problem

When a Web client shares the screen, the screen freezes or blurs.

## Solution

Find the solution that corresponds to the version of the Web SDK you are using.

### Web 3.x

Troubleshoot the problem by following the steps below:

1. Ask the user to use the latest official version of the Chrome browser on desktop.
2. Set codec as `vp8` when calling `createClient`.
3. Check whether the user is sharing an application window.
   - If so, ask the user to share the browser tab or the entire screen instead.
   - If not, check the encoding configurations you set in `setScreenProfile`.
4. Upgrade the SDK to 3.2.0 or later versions, and set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_PREVIOUS_ROOT}}/interfaces/agorartc.streamspec.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> when creating the stream for screen-sharing. Choose the appropriate transmission optimization mode according to the shared content:
   - If the shared content is mainly slides, texts, or static images, set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_PREVIOUS_ROOT}}/interfaces/agorartc.streamspec.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> as `"details"`.
   - If the shared content is mainly videos or games, set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_PREVIOUS_ROOT}}/interfaces/agorartc.streamspec.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> as `"motion"`.

### Web 4.x

Troubleshoot the problem by following the steps below:

1. Ask the user to use the latest official version of the Chrome browser on desktop.
2. Set codec as `vp8` when calling `createClient`.
3. Check whether the user is sharing an application window.
   - If so, ask the user to share a browser tab or the entire screen.
   - If not, check the encoding configurations you set in `createScreenVideoTrack`.
4. Set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/screenvideotrackinitconfig.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> when creating the video track for screen sharing, and choose the appropriate transmission optimization mode according to the shared content:

   - If the shared content is mainly slides, texts, or static images, set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/screenvideotrackinitconfig.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> as "details".
   - If the shared content is mainly videos or games, set <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/screenvideotrackinitconfig.html#optimizationmode">`optimizationMode`</Link> as `"motion"`.

As of v4.2.0, you can change the transmission optimization mode during a screen sharing session by calling <Link to="{{GLOBAL.API_REF_WEB_ROOT}}/interfaces/ilocalvideotrack.html#setoptimizationmode">`setOptimizationMode`</Link>.
