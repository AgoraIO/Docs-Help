## Issue description

After screen locking or switching to the background on some Android versions, you may encounter the following issues:

- Audio is silent or video is not visible within 1 minute of screen locking of an Android device.
- Audio is silent after cutting to the settings page to open the hover window permission while the Android app is running.

## Reason

Since Android 9, the Android system has restricted access to user data by background apps. See [Android behavior changes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all) for details.

## Solution

At present, the official Android website does not specify how the background capture of audio and video should be handled, but you can use the foreground service to notify the operating system that, when the device is in the lock screen state or the app is switched to the background, you still need to use the microphone, camera, media playback, and other functions. This is to ensure that the specific system functions can continue to operate to avoid interruptions in audio and video capture due to system limitations. The specific steps are as follows:

    1. In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, declare the foreground service privilege (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`) and specify the foreground service type (`foregroundServiceType`). For real-time audio/video interactive apps, you usually need to specify the microphone (`microphone`), camera (`camera`), and media playback (`mediaPlayback`) service types. The example code is as follows:

        ``` xml
        <manifest ...>
            <!-- Declare front-end service permissions -->
            <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />

            <application ...>
                ...
                <!-- Specify the type of front desk service -->
                <service
                    android:name=".YourForegroundService"
                    android:foregroundServiceType="microphone|camera|mediaPlayback" />
                ...
            </application>
        </manifest>
        ```

    1. When a service is created, call `startForeground` to promote the specified service to the foreground. The sample code is as follows:

        ``` java
        @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            // Get default notifications
            Notification notification = getDefaultNotification();
            try {
                // Depending on the Android version, choose the appropriate way to handle the frontend service
                if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.R) {
                    // For Android 11 and above, start the foreground service and specify multiple service types
                    int serviceTypes = ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MICROPHONE |
                                    ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA |
                                    ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK;
                    this.startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification, serviceTypes);
                } else {
                    // For Android 11 and below, there is no need to specify a service type, simply start the foreground service
                    this.startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
                }
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                Log.e(TAG, "Error starting foreground service", ex);
            }
        }
        ```

    1. When the app switches to the background, call `startForegroundService` to start the service to ensure that the service continues to run. The sample code is as follows:

        ``` java
        @Override
        public void onPause() {
            super.onPause();
            startRecordingService();
        }

        private void startRecordingService() {
            if (joined) {
                // Create an intent
                Intent intent = new Intent(requireContext(), LocalRecordingService.class);
                // Depending on the Android version, choose the appropriate way to start the frontend service
                if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
                    // For Android 8 and above, start the service using startForegroundService
                    requireContext().startForegroundService(intent);
                } else {
                    // For Android 8 and below, use startService to start the service
                    requireContext().startService(intent);
                }
            }
        }
        ```
