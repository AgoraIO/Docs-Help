If your total service minutes do not exceed 10,000 minutes, the service is free of charge. After the 10,000 free-of-charge minutes are fully deducted, Agora charges you for the additional service minutes.

The remaining free-of-charge minutes are cleared at the end of each
calendar month.

- The 10,000 free-of-charge minutes policy does not apply to CDN live
streaming. Using this service leads to immediate account freeze. If your
app scenario involves CDN live streaming, we recommend adding a credit
card to your account, making a payment, or signing a contract with Agora.

- The 10,000 free-of-charge minutes policy does not apply to the Agora Signaling
SDK.
