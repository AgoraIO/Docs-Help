This page provides solutions to issues that users may encounter when using Agora Console.

## Why can't I use my email address to login to Agora Console after successfully signing up with a third-party account?

**Issue description**

You can log in to Agora Console with a registered email address or third-party account, such as Google, GitHub, or WeChat. During this process, you may encounter the following issues:

- Have signed up to Agora Console with a third-party account, but cannot use the e-mail address and password of the third-party account to login to Agora Console.
- Have signed up to Agora Console with an email address but cannot bind the Agora account to a third-party account.

**Reason**

The email signup and login is independent of the third-party signup and login within Agora Console. You can only use the credentials that you used to sign up to Agora Console for your logins.

**Solution**

- If you have signed up to Agora Console with a third-party account, use the third-party account for your logins.
- If you have signed up to Agora Console with your email address, use this along with your password for your logins or provide a phone number for code verification. You cannot bind your Agora account to a third-party account, even if it shares the same email address.

## Why can't I log in to Agora Console with my email address and password?

**Issue description**

Email address login failures are covered in the following scenarios:

- Cannot login after signing up with a third-party account.
- Cannot login after signing up with an email account.

**Reason**

The email signup and login is independent of the third-party signup and login within Agora Console. You can only use the credentials that you used to sign up to Agora Console for your logins.

**Solution**

- If you have signed up to Agora Console with a third-party account, use the third-party account for your logins.
- If you have signed up with an email address, check if your password is correct. If you have forgotten your password, either [reset your password](https://sso.agora.io/forget) or log in with a phone number and a received verification code.

## Why can't I submit an ID Authentication at Agora Console?

**Issue description**

You cannot submit an ID Authentication at Agora Console after verifying your phone number.

**Reason**

**ID Authentication** is required only for the following users:

- A user who has passed phone number verification and whose number is from mainland China.
- A user who has completed email verification and whose IP address is from mainland China.

Users that do not fall into the above two categories can use the Agora services directly without the need for an ID authentication.

**Solution**

If your verified phone number or network IP address does not belong to mainland China, real-name authentication is not required. If you wish to submit real-name authentication information, please modify your phone number or network IP address in the console to one belonging to mainland China.

## How to Switch from the International Console Account to the Domestic Console Account?

**Issue description**

Due to business requirements or operational errors, some users need to switch their console account from the [International version](https://console.agora.io) to the [Domestic version](https://console.shengwang.cn/), but cannot find the switch settings in the console.

**Reason**

To comply with data security and compliance requirements, Agora's international and domestic console versions have data isolation, so users cannot switch account regions on their own.

**Solution**

- If there is minimal project data in your account, Agora recommends registering a new domestic version account. See [Account Registration](/doc/console/general/quickstart#register-account) for details.
- If there is significant project data in your account, contact sales at [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) for assistance with account switching and data migration.

<Admonition type="danger" title="Warning">
- Agora only supports switching from an International console account to a Domestic console account; reverse operations are not supported.
- Once you switch your International console account to a Domestic console account, this operation cannot be undone. Therefore, please proceed with caution.
