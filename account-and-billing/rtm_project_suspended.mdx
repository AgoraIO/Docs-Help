If the number of daily active users (DAU) in your RTM project exceeds 1,000, check whether you have registered with Agora and done any of the following:
- Added a credit card to your account or topped up your balance using a bank account.
- You have recently made a payment.
- Signed a contract with Agora.

Otherwise, your account may be suspended on the second day. After account suspension, none of your projects can access the Agora services.
