### How to disable 3A (noise reduction, echo cancellation, gain) configuration on the web?

If your classroom integrates or uses audio mixing or other tools, and you want to turn off the noise reduction, echo cancellation, and gain functions, you `packages/agora-classroom-sdk/src/infra/api/index.tsx` can add the following code to achieve it:

```typescript
 if (AgoraRteRuntimePlatform.Electron === AgoraRteEngineConfig.platform) {
      rtcSDKParameters = [
        { 'rtc.audio.aec.enable': false },
        { 'rtc.audio.agc.enable': false },
        { 'rtc.audio.ans.enable': false },
      ];
    } else {
      rtcSDKParameters = [
        {
          MEDIA_DEVICE_CONSTRAINTS: {
            audio: {
              autoGainControl: false,
              echoCancellation: false,
              noiseSuppression: false,
            },
          },
        },
      ];
    }
```
