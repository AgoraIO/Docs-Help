1. Please refer to Configuring the recording function to check whether the recording-related configuration is correct, among which:

   - Recording Configuration `recordingConfig` If not set, the default configuration will be used automatically.
   - Storage configuration `storageConfig` must be configured correctly, in particular `vendor`, `region` and `endpoint` fields are correct and match. For example, if the third-party cloud storage service area you use is Shanghai, the application server you initiate the request must also be located in Shanghai. Refer to the following example:
     ```json
     "vendor": 2,
     "region": 1, //CN_Shanghai
     endpoint:https://agora-recording.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com
     ```

1. If the above configurations are correct and the recording still fails, please check whether the public read permission of the third-party cloud storage account you are using is enabled, see Notes for details .

1. If the recording configuration is correct and the public read permission is turned on, but the recording still fails to record, Shengwang recommends that you debug the specific cause of the error in the local browser by splicing the URL recorded on the page.

   1. Obtain the value URL1 of the URL of the recording page passed in by calling `LaunchOption` the parameter `recordUrl`.
   1. Call the RESTful API to get the recording list , and get URL2 webRecordUrlQueryfrom`.
   1. By splicing URL1 and URL2, you get the complete URL of the page recording, which can be accessed locally through a browser for debugging.

If it can be opened normally, the recording is enabled successfully; if it cannot be opened, you can find out the reason according to the error report.
