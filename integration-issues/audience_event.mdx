The Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> does not provide any callback events that listen for an audience joining or leaving an interactive live streaming channel. However, you can listen for these events using either of the following two approaches:

- By using the event notifications provided by Agora's message notification service.
- By using the signaling service provided by the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.

## Use the message notification service (Beta)
<div class="alert note">Agora Message Notification Service is in the Beta stage. Agora recommends that core apps should not rely on the Message Notification Service.</div>

The message notification service enables you to listen for various service events, which are sent to your Server in the form of HTTP/HTTPS requests.

### Implementation

1. Enable the message notification service.
2. Once the service is enabled, the message notification service sends messages to your Server as HTTP/HTTPS POST requests. Listen for the following events of the **Real-Time Communication** service to detect whether an audience joins or leaves an interactive live streaming channel:

| event_type | event_name | Description | Field name of payload |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 105      | `audience join channel`      | In the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile, an audience joins the channel.      |<ul><li>channelName</li><li>uid</li><li>platform</li><li>ts</li></ul> |
| 106      | `audience leave channel`   | In the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile, an audience leaves the channel      |<ul><li>channelName</li><li>uid</li><li>platform</li><li>reason</li><li>ts</li></ul> |

## Use the signaling service

The Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> aims at providing stable signaling services, such as maintaining the channel information and sending real-time messages, for various social and education scenarios.

### Implementation

By integrating both the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> and the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, you can listen for the callback events of the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> to detect the states of the audience in the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel:

- Let a user join both an <Vg k="VSDK" /> and an <Vg k="MESS" /> channel. Ensure that the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel and the <Vg k="MESS" /> channel share the same channel name.
- Bind the actions of joining both channels in your code logic.
- As a result, the <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> reporting that a user has joined the <Vg k="MESS" /> channel means that the user has joined the <Vg k="VSDK" /> channel as well. The same applies to a user leaving the channel.
