## Introduction

In a live interactive streaming channel, the host can invite an audience to take on the role of co-host, or change role back to audience.

You can implement this function by combining the following features:

- <Vg k="MESS" /> and channel attributes using methods from the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />.
- Setting the user role using methods from the Agora <Vg k="VSDK" />.

## Implementation

Before proceeding, ensure that you have integrated both the Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> and <Vg k="VSDK" /> in your project. For how to integrate these SDKs, see the following guides:

- [Agora <Vg k="MESS_SDK" /> Quickstart](../../signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk)
- [Agora <Vg k="VSDK" /> Quickstart](../../interactive-live-streaming/get-started/get-started-sdk)

The basic API call sequence is as follows:

Refer to the detailed steps for implementation:

1. The host calls v to send a peer-to-peer message that invites an audience to take on the role pf co-host.
2. The audience receives the invitation message in the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/interfaceio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_client_listener.html#af760814981718fb31d88acb8251d19b6">`onMessageReceived`</Link> callback.
3. The audience calls <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ANDROID_ROOT}}/class_irtcengine.html#api_irtcengine_setclientrole">`setClientRole`</Link> to change the user role to `CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER`.
4. After successfully changing the user role, the audience receives the `onClientRoleChanged` callback, and becomes a co-host.
5. The new co-host calls <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_client.html#a997a31e6bfe1edc9b6ef58a931ef3f23">`onMessageReceived`</Link> to notify the role change to all users in the channel.
6. The host receives the <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/interfaceio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_channel_listener.html#a2904a1f1f78c497b9176fffb853be96f">`onAttributesUpdated`</Link>) callback, and starts co-hosting with the new co-host.

To change a co-host back to an audience, follow the same steps, except when calling `setClientRole`, set the user role as `CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE`.
