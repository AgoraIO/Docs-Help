In <Vg k="MESS_SDK" />, the call frequency limit refers to the limit of one client instance.

- For the native platform, you can increase the call limit of an API by creating multiple client instances.
- For the web platform, we <b>do not recommend</b> increasing the call limit by creating multiple client instances.
