When calling `startAudioMixing` or `playEffect` to play a stereo file, the user might encounter the issue of not being able to hear audio in stereo.

## Reason

If you cannot hear stereo audio, the possible reasons are as follows:

- The audio file being played is not a stereo file.
- Stereo encoding is not set in the Agora SDK.
- The audio playback device does not support stereo audio.

## Solution

To troubleshoot and solve the issue, do the following:

### Step 1: Check the audio file

Check whether the audio file is a stereo file by viewing the audio signal.

- If the audio file has only a mono audio signal, or if the audio file has dual audio signals but the audio signals of the left and right channels are the same, the audio file is not a stereo file. Change the file to a stereo file.
- If the audio file has dual audio signals and the audio signals of the left and right channels are different, the audio file is a stereo file. Proceed to step 2 to check the SDK settings.

### Step 2: Check the SDK settings

The SDK can correctly encode and transmit stereo audio only when you set the stereo encoding. Check whether you call `setAudioProfile` and set the `profile` parameter to `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_STANDARD_STEREO` (3) or `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO` (5).

- If a stereo profile is not set, set the `profile` parameter correctly.
- If the profile is set correctly, proceed to step 3 to check the audio playback device.

### Step 3: Check the audio playback device

Check whether the device supports stereo audio, and check whether the device is working properly.

- If the device does not support stereo audio, change it to a device that supports stereo audio.
- If the device supports stereo audio but does not work properly, contact the device manufacturer for repair or change it to a device that works properly.
- If the device supports stereo audio and works properly, [submit a ticket](https://agora-ticket.agora.io/) to contact Agora customer support for further exploration of the issue.

<Admonition type="note">
If you use a Bluetooth device to play audio, note the Bluetooth profile. The two common profiles are as follows:
- **Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP):** The unidirectional transmission of high-quality audio data, usually for stereo music playback. A2DP does not support capturing audio through the Bluetooth device, so you need to use other devices to capture audio.
- **Hands-Free Profile (HFP):** The bidirectional transmission of audio data, usually for audio calls. HFP commonly uses Synchronous Connection Oriented link (SCO) to carry a mono audio channel, so a Bluetooth device cannot play stereo audio using HFP.
