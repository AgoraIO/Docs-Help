When running `pod install`, the following error occurs:

```shell
[!] Invalid Podfile file: /xxx/ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig must exist. If youâ€™re running pod install manually, make sure flutter pub get is executed first.
```

## Reason

The error message indicates that the `Generated.xcconfig` file is missing. This file is necessary for building the Flutter app on iOS devices. If you do not run `flutter pub get` to generate this file before executing `pod install`, you will encounter this error.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project.
1. Run the `flutter pub get` command to fetch and update the project's dependencies. This command will also generate the `Generated.xcconfig` file and other necessary configuration files.
1. Rerun `pod install`.
