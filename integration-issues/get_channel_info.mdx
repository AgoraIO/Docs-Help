<Vg k="COMPANY"/> provides server-side RESTful APIs to obtain channel-related information.

To retrieve the channel list for your project, use the [Query project](/video-calling/channel-management-api/endpoint/query-channel-information/query-channel-list) API. By providing your App ID, you can get details such as the number of channels, channel names, and the number of users in each channel.

Additionally, you can query the user list by specifying a channel name. If the channel exists, you can obtain details like the channel mode, the number of users, and the user IDs of all participants.
