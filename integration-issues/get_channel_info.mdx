<Vg k="COMPANY"/> currently allows you to obtain channel-related information through the server-side RESTful API.

To retrieve the channel list for your project, use the [query project](/video-calling/channel-management-api/endpoint/query-channel-information/query-channel-list) API. By providing your App ID, you can get details such as the number of channels, channel names, and the number of users in each channel.

Additionally, you can query the user list by specifying a channel name. If the channel exists, you can retrieve details such as the channel mode, the number of users, and the user IDs of all participants.
