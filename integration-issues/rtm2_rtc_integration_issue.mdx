When integrating Signaling SDK version 2.2.0 and above with RTC SDK version 4.3.0 and above, the following errors may appear in the IDE:

- **Android:**
    ```java
    com.android.builder.merge.DuplicateRelativeFileException: More than one file was found with OS independent path 'lib/x86/libaosl.so'
    ```

- **IOS:**

    ```objc
    Unexpected duplicate tasks
    Multiple commands produce <your_app_build_path>/Contents/Frameworks/aosl.framework/Versions/A'
    ```

## Reason

Both Signaling SDK versions 2.2.0 and above and RTC SDK versions 4.3.0 and above use the same library:

    - **Android SDK**: `lib/x86/libaosl.so`
    - **IOS SDK**: `libs/aosl.xcframework`
    As a result, the IDE detects multiple files with the same path during the build process, leading to errors.

## Solution

### Android SDK

Depending on your integration method, follow the corresponding solution below:

  - **Using CDN**

      1. Manually delete the following files in the SDK package:
        - `lib/x86/libaosl.so`
        - `lib/x86_64/libaosl.so`
        - `lib/armeabi-v7a/libaosl.so`
        - `lib/arm64-v8a/libaosl.so`
      2. Rebuild the project.

  - **Using Maven**
      1. Add the `packagingOptions` node to the `android` node in the `build.gradle` file to specify that the first matching file is preferred during the build process:
        ```groovy
        android {
          // ...
          packagingOptions {
            pickFirst 'lib/x86/libaosl.so'
            pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libaosl.so'
            pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libaosl.so'
            pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libaosl.so'
          }
        }
        ```
      2. After the Gradle file synchronization is complete, rebuild the project.


### IOS SDK

Depending on your integration method, follow the corresponding solution below:

  - **Using CDN**
      1. Manually delete the `libs/aosl.xcframework` file in the SDK package.
      2. Rebuild the project.
  - **Using CocoaPods**
      1. After successfully running the `pod install` command to install the SDK, manually delete the `aosl.xcframework` file in the project's `/Pods/AgoraRtm` path.
      2. Rebuild the project.
