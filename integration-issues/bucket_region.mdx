Currently, cloud recording supports the following cloud storage vendors:

- Amazon S3
- Alibaba Cloud
- Tencent Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud
- Huawei Cloud
- Baidu Smart Cloud

Before initiating cloud recording, ensure you have activated at least one of the above vendors' cloud storage services and created a bucket. Then, fill in the relevant cloud storage information in the `storageConfig` parameter of the [Start Cloud Recording API](/cloud-recording/get-started/getstarted#start-recording) request. When selecting the `region` for your bucket, choose one that is close to the server initiating the cloud recording request. For a specific vendor region comparison table, see [Third-Party Storage Regions](/cloud-recording/reference/region-vendor).

The files uploaded for cloud recording are stored on machines near the server that initiated the request. Therefore, if the cloud storage is cross-region (for example, if the server initiating the request is in the United States and the selected bucket region is in Beijing), uploads may be slow or may even fail. While Agora Backup Cloud can back up some files that fail to upload, keep in mind that cloud recording only waits for a limited time after the recording is complete. If the upload does not finish within the timeout period, the task will be terminated, and the recorded file will be lost. Thus, cross-region uploading can significantly impact upload delays and outcomes.
