## Volume type introduction

The in-call volume refers to the volume of voice and video calls, while the media volume refers to the volume at which background music, videos, and audio effects are played. The in-call volume and the media volume are independent from each other, and the setting of one does not affect the other. The differences between the in-call volume and the media volume are as follows:

|                             | In-call volume                                             | Media volume                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audio quality               | Lower.                                                     | Higher, with good audio performance.                       |
| Volume                      | Cannot be adjusted to 0.                                   | Can be adjusted to 0.                                      |
| Echo cancellation algorithm | Uses the echo cancellation algorithm of the device system to completely eliminate the echo generated by the user's device, but may also mute music or voice. | Uses the echo cancellation algorithm of the Agora Video SDK and might not eliminate the echo entirely, while having less impact on music or voice. |

The system volume is the volume adjusted on the device, which is controlled by the volume type used by the Agora Video SDK. For example, if the SDK uses the in-call volume, then when you adjust the system volume, you actually adjust the in-call volume.

The volume type used by the SDK is determined by the audio route, the user role set in `setClientRole`, and the audio scenario set in `setAudioProfile`. The following tables show the volume types used by the SDK in each scenario:

### Android

- In the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_DEFAULT` scenario:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker | Earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume | Media volume |

- In the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_GAME_STREAMING`, `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHORUS`, or `AUDIO_SCENARIO_MEETING` scenario:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker | Earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume | Media volume |

- In the `AUDIO_SCENARIO_CHATROOM` scenario:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker | Earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |

### iOS

- In the `AgoraAudioScenarioDefault` scenario:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker or earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | Media volume | In-call volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | Media volume | Media volume |

- In `AgoraAudioScenarioGameStreaming`, `AgoraAudioScenarioChorus`, or `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting` scenarios:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker or earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | Media volume | Media volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | Media volume | Media volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | Media volume | Media volume |

- In `AgoraAudioScenarioChatRoom` scenario:

    | User role | Wired headphones | Speaker or earpiece | Bluetooth earphone |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Multiple hosts | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Single host | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |
    | Audience | Media volume | In-call volume | In-call volume |

## Q & A

**I set the volume of the game effects before joining the channel, why did the volume change after joining a channel?**

The in-call volume and the media volume are independent from each other, and the setting of one does not affect the other. Before joining the channel, the volume that the user adjusts on the device is media volume; after joining the channel, if the Agora Video SDK uses the in-call volume, and the media volume and the in-call volume of the user's device are different, the volume of the game effects changes. To avoid this issue, Agora recommends setting the SDK's volume type to media volume by referring to [Volume type introduction](#volume-type-introduction).
