In real-time audio or video communication, you can use the Agora RTM SDK or the Agora RTC SDK to determine whether an incoming or ongoing call is an audio call or a video call.

## Before a call

If you need to determine and send the call type to the receiver before a call, ensure that you have integrated the RTM SDK and the RTC SDK. Refer to the following articles to learn more about integration:

- [RTM SDK Quickstart](../../signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk)
- [RTC SDK Quickstart](../../interactive-live-streaming/get-started/get-started-sdk)

Complete the following steps to determine the call type:

1. When the caller sends a call, use the [Call Invitation API](../../signaling/develop/call-invitation) of the RTM SDK to send a call invitation to the callee.
2. Call <Link to="{{Global.SIG_SDK_API_ANDROID}}/classio_1_1agora_1_1rtm_1_1_rtm_client.html#a729079805644b3307297fb2e902ab4c9">`sendMessageToPeer`</Link> to send the call type to the callee via peer-to-peer message. The callee gets the call type from the received peer-to-peer message.

## After a call

If you need to determine and send the call type to the receiver during a call, ensure that you have integrated the RTC SDK. Refer to the following article:

- [RTC SDK Quickstart](../../interactive-live-streaming/get-started/get-started-sdk)

During a call, the receiver can determine the call type according to the following guideline:

- If the receiver receives the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ANDROID_ROOT}}/class_irtcengineeventhandler.html#callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onremotevideostatechanged">onRemoteVideoStateChange</Link> callback, the current call is a video call.
- If the receiver does not receive the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ANDROID_ROOT}}/class_irtcengineeventhandler.html#callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onremotevideostatechanged">onRemoteVideoStateChange</Link> callback and receives the <Link to="{{Global.API_REF_ANDROID_ROOT}}/class_irtcengineeventhandler.html#callback_irtcengineeventhandler_onremoteaudiostatechanged">onRemoteVideoStateChange</Link> callback, the current call is an audio call.
