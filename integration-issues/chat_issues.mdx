### The chat is not displayed in the classroom. The classroom is integrated with Agora Chat, but users cannot log in.

If the user cannot use or log into instant chat in the classroom, check whether Chat configuration in the Console is correct.

### Failed to send a message in class

If the user fails to send messages in the room, it may be because the user has not successfully registered. You can go to the instant messaging service overview page of Huanxin developer management background and set the user registration mode to open registration.
