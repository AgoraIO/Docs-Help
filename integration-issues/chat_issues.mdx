### The chat plug-in in the classroom is not displayed? The classroom integrates Huanxin IM but cannot log in?

If the user cannot use the instant chat function in the classroom, or the classroom has integrated Huanxin IM but cannot log in to the system, you need to refer to Configuring Huanxin IM to check whether the configuration related to Huanxin in the console is correct. If the configuration is incorrect, Huanxin related plug-ins cannot be used normally.

### Failed to send message in class

If the user fails to send messages in the room, it may be because the user has not successfully registered. You can go to the instant messaging service overview page of Huanxin developer management background and set the user registration mode to open registration.
