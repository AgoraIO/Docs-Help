## Understand the tech

Co-host authentication is the means by which the SDK authenticates whether a user has the privilege to publish streams in a live streaming channel.

This function guarantees that only authorized users can publish streams in a channel and prevents illegal users from deliberately disrupting a streaming session.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your app meets the following requirements:

- Uses the Agora Video SDK v2.1.0 or later.
- Uses only token-based authentication on all app clients to authenticate users. For details, see [Upgrade authentication mechanism](/en/video-calling/develop/authentication-workflow).

## Implementation

### 1. Modify the parameter setting

This section introduces how to set the role parameter when generating a token using C++ as an example. The principles and goals are the same if you are using another programming language.

```cpp
// API
static std::string buildTokenWithUid(
    const std::string& appId,
    const std::string& appCertificate,
    const std::string& channelName,
    uint32_t uid,
    UserRole role,
    uint32_t privilegeExpiredTs = 0);


// Code sample
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {

  // Your App ID
  std::string appID  = "970Cxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1b33";
  // Your App Certificate
  std::string  appCertificate = "5CFdxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx5d3b";
  // The channel name
  std::string channelName= "7d72xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbdda";
  // The user ID. If you set it as 0, the SDK does not authenticate the user
  uint32_t uid = 2882341273;
  // The expiration time of the token
  uint32_t expirationTimeInSeconds = 3600;
  uint32_t currentTimeStamp = time(NULL);
  uint32_t privilegeExpiredTs = currentTimeStamp + expirationTimeInSeconds;
  std::string result;

  result = RtcTokenBuilder::buildTokenWithUid(
      appID, appCertificate, channelName, uid, UserRole::Role_Publisher,
      privilegeExpiredTs);
  std::cout << "Token With Int Uid:" << result << std::endl;
```

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `role`    | The publishing privilege of the user: <ul><li>`Role_Publisher(1)`: (Default) The user has the publishing privilege.</li><li>`Role_Subscriber(2)`: The user does not have the publishing privilege.</li></ul> |

### 2. Change the app logic

Refer to the following steps to authenticate whether a user has the publishing privilege (in scenarios where an audience member wants to become a host:

1. Before joining a channel, the app client applies for a token with the privilege of a subscriber. The app server generates a token and passes it to the app client.
2. The app client calls `joinChannel` and passes the token to the SDK.
3. Before changing the user role, the app client applies for a token with the privilege of a publisher. The app client generates a second toke, and passes it to the app client.
4. The app client calls `renewToken` and passes the new token to the SDK.
5. The app client calls `setClientRole` to change the user role from an audience member to a host. The Agora server authenticates the token when the app client calls `setClientRole`. If the token is generated with the privilege of a publisher, the app client can publish a stream.

<div class="alert note">
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the user wants to switch from a host to an audience member, repeat
      steps 3 to 5. Apply for a token with the privilege of an audience, call{' '}
      <code>renewToken</code> on the app client, and then call{' '}
      <code>setClientRole</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the token expires, you need to generate a new token on the app server
      and call <code>renewToken</code> to pass the new token to the SDK. The new
      token also has a service validity period.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### 3. Enable co-host authentication

Refer to the following steps to enable this function in Agora Console:

1. Log on to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Under **Projects**, choose a project for which you want to enable co-host authentication, click the **Edit** icon, and enter the **Edit Project** page.
2. In the Features area, click **Enable authentication**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to know more about this function, check the box, and click **Enable**.

Co-host authentication takes effect in 5 minutes.

Once you have enabled co-host authentication, a user using your app must meet both of the following requirements to publish streams in a channel:

- The user role in `setClientRole` is set as `BROADCASTER`.
- The user joins the channel with a token that has the privilege of a publisher (by setting the `role` parameter in the `buildToken` method as `Role_Publisher`).

## Reference

**1. Suppose a user takes the role of broadcaster. After I enable co-host authentication, will the user be able to publish streams?**

Answer: Yes. After the token expires, you need to generate a new token with the privilege of a publisher, and call renewToken to pass the new token to the SDK.

**2. Suppose a user takes the role of audience. After I enable co-host authentication, what should I do if this user wants to switch to broadcaster and publish streams?**

Answer: Once co-host authentication is enabled, a user needs to meet both of the following requirements to publish streams:

1. The user role in `setClientRole` is set as `BROADCASTER`.
2. The user joins the channel with a token that has the privilege of a publisher (by setting the `role` parameter in the `buildToken` method as `Role_Publisher`).

Therefore, for an audience member to become a host and publish streams, you need to follow steps in [Change the app logic](#app_logic): generate a token with the privilege of a publisher, call `renewToken` to pass the new token to the SDK, and then call `setClientRole` to change the user role to broadcaster.
