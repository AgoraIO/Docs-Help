Co-host authentication enables you to authenticate whether a user has the privilege to publish streams in a live streaming channel. This feature helps ensure that only authorized users publish streams and prevents illegal users from exploiting business vulnerabilities or stealing tokens to bomb a live broadcast room.

## Understand the tech

You deploy a token server and generate tokens with the required privileges; the <Vg k="COMPANY" /> server verifies the tokens you generate.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Note">
* Using co-host authentication requires app logic changes. Ensure that you
      read this article before enabling this function.

* Co-host authentication applies to scenarios where the channel profile is
      set to **Live Broadcasting**.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that your app meets the following requirements:

- Uses the Agora Video SDK v2.1.0 or later.
- Uses only token-based authentication on all app clients to authenticate users. For details, see [Upgrade authentication mechanism](/realtime-communication/token-authentication/authentication-workflow).

## Implementation

### Set the `role` parameter

This section shows you how to set the `role` parameter when generating a token using `AccessToken2`. The following code uses C++ as an example but the principles and steps remain the same if you use another programming language to build your token server.

    ```cpp
    #include <cstdlib>
    #include <iostream>

    #include "../src/RtcTokenBuilder2.h"

    using namespace agora::tools;

    int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
      (void)argc;
      (void)argv;

      // Get the value of the environment variable AGORA_APP_ID. Make sure you set this variable to your App ID obtained from Agora Console
      const char *env_app_id = getenv("AGORA_APP_ID");
      std::string app_id = env_app_id ? env_app_id : "";
      // Get the value of the environment variable AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE. Make sure you set this variable to your App Certificate obtained from Agora Console
      const char *env_app_certificate = getenv("AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE");
      std::string app_certificate = env_app_certificate ? env_app_certificate : "";
      // Replace channelName with the channel name you want to join
      std::string channel_name = "channelName";
      // Fill in your actual user ID
      uint32_t uid = 2882341273;
      // Token expiration time in seconds
      uint32_t token_expiration_in_seconds = 3600;
      // Privilege expiration time for all permissions in seconds
      uint32_t privilege_expiration_in_seconds = 3600;
      std::string result;

      std::cout << "App Id:" << app_id << std::endl;
      std::cout << "App Certificate:" << app_certificate << std::endl;
      if (app_id == "" || app_certificate == "") {
        std::cout << "Need to set environment variable AGORA_APP_ID and "
                    "AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE"
                  << std::endl;
        return -1;
      }
      // Generate Token
      result = RtcTokenBuilder2::BuildTokenWithUid(
          app_id, app_certificate, channel_name, uid, UserRole::kRolePublisher,
          token_expiration_in_seconds, privilege_expiration_in_seconds);
      std::cout << "Token With Int Uid:" << result << std::endl;

      return 0;
    }
    ```

  | Parameter | Description             |
  | --------- | ----------------------- |
  | `role`    | The publishing privilege of the user: <ul><li>`kRolePublisher` (1): (Default) The user has the the privilege to publish streams.</li><li>`kRoleSubscriber` (2): The user does not have the privilege to publish streams.</li></ul> |

### Modify the app logic

Refer to the following steps to authenticate whether a user has the publishing privilege in scenarios where an audience member wants to become a host:

1. Before joining a channel, the app client applies for a token with the privilege of a subscriber. The app server generates a token and passes it to the app client.
2. The app client calls `joinChannel` and passes the token generated with `kRoleSubscriber` privilege to the SDK.
3. Before changing the user role from audience to host, the app client applies for a token with the privilege of `kRolePublisher`. The app server generates a second token, and passes it to the app client.
4. The app client calls `renewToken` and passes the new token to the SDK.
5. The app client calls `setClientRole` to change the user role from an audience member to a host. The Agora server authenticates the token when the app client calls `setClientRole`. If the token is generated with the privilege of `kRolePublisher`, the app client can publish streams.

<Admonition type="caution" title ="Note">

* If the user wants to switch from a host to an audience member, repeat steps 3 to 5. Apply for a token with the privilege of `kRoleSubscriber`, call `renewToken` on the app client, and then call `setClientRole`.
  
* When the token expires, you generate a new token on the app server and call `renewToken` to pass the fresh token to the SDK. The new token also has a service validity period.

### Enable co-host authentication

Refer to the following steps to enable co-host authentication in Agora Console:

1. Log in to <Link to="{{Global.AGORA_CONSOLE_URL}}"><Vg k="CONSOLE" /></Link>. Under **Projects**, choose a project for which you want to enable co-host authentication, click the **Edit** icon, and enter the **Edit Project** page.
2. In the All Features area, click **Co-Host authentication**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to know more about this function, and click **Enable Co-host authentication**. Co-host authentication takes effect in 5 minutes.


## FAQs

1. **Suppose a user takes the role of broadcaster. After I enable co-host authentication, will the user be able to publish streams?**

    Answer: Yes. After the token expires, you need to generate a new token with the privilege of `kRolePublisher`, and call `renewToken` to pass the new token to the SDK.

2. **Suppose a user takes the role of audience. After I enable co-host authentication, what should I do if this user wants to switch to broadcaster and publish streams?**

    Answer: Once co-host authentication is enabled, a user needs to meet both of the following requirements to publish streams:

    - The user role in `setClientRole` is set as **Broadcaster**.
    - The user joins the channel with a token generated by setting the `role` parameter in the `buildToken` method to `kRolePublisher`.

    To summarize, for an audience member to become a host and publish streams, you need to follow steps in [Modify the app logic](#modify-the-app-logic), generate a token with the privilege of a publisher, call `renewToken` to pass the new token to the SDK, and then call `setClientRole` to change the user role to broadcaster.
