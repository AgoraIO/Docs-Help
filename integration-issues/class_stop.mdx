In Flexible Classroom, the teacher can click **Leave Classroom** to temporarily exit the session without changing the room status. To officially end the class, follow these steps:

1. The teacher calls the `leaveClassroom` method to exit the classroom. Here is a sample code snippet:

    ```javascript
    this.classroomStore.connectionStore.leaveClassroom(LeaveReason.leave);
    ```
    After executing this method, the classroom status will reflect the following states:

    ```javascript
    ClassState {
        beforeClass: 0, // Class has not started
        ongoing: 1,     // Class is ongoing
        afterClass: 2,  // Class has ended, but the classroom still exists
        close: 3        // Classroom is closed
    }
    ```

2. To actively end the room, call the room status update interface `RoomStore:updateClassState`. Hereâ€™s how:
    ```javascript
    // End the room
    this.classroomStore.roomStore.updateClassState(ClassState.close);
    ```

3. If you need to end the course without direct interaction, call Flexible Classroom backend RESTful interface [Set Classroom Status](/flexible-classroom/restful-api/classroom-api?platform=android#set-the-classroom-state). Set the class status to one of the following values:

    - **0**: Not started
    - **1**: In progress
    - **2**: Ended. The class time has elapsed, but users can join and remain during the extended time.
    - **3**: Closed. The class is closed after the extended time, and all users are removed and cannot rejoin.
