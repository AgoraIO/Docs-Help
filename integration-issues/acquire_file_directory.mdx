You can get the filename of the M3U8 file from the following fields:

- The `fileList` field in the responses of [`query`](/cloud-recording/reference/restful-api#query) and [`stop`](/cloud-recording/reference/restful-api#stop).
- The `fileList` field in the [`cloud_recording_file_infos`](/cloud-recording/reference/rest-api-overview#4-cloud_recording_file_infos) callback event.
