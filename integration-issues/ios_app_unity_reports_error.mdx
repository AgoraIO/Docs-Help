When you package and upload an app developed using Unity 4.x SDK directly to the App Store, you may receive the following error message:

![1667533013233](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1667533013233)

The iOS dynamic library inside the SDK v4.x for Unity has a simulator architecture, which the App Store does not allow. In order to launch and test the app, the simulator architecture in the SDK needs to be deleted. To do so, take the following steps:

1. In Xcode, select **New Run Script Phase**.

    ![1667533033937](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1667533033937)

1. Add the following script to automatically delete the simulator architecture in the SDK when packaging:

    ```swift
    #!/bin/sh

    # Strip invalid architectures

    strip_invalid_archs() {
    binary="$1"
    echo "current binary ${binary}"
    # Get architectures for current file
    archs="$(lipo -info "$binary" | rev | cut -d ':' -f1 | rev)"
    stripped=""
    for arch in $archs; do
    if ! [[ "${ARCHS}" == *"$arch"* ]]; then
    if [ -f "$binary" ]; then
    # Strip non-valid architectures in-place
    lipo -remove "$arch" -output "$binary" "$binary" || exit 1
    stripped="$stripped $arch"
    fi
    fi
    done
    if [[ "$stripped" ]]; then
    echo "Stripped $binary of architectures:$stripped"
    fi
    }

    APP_PATH="${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}"

    # This script loops through the frameworks embedded in the application and
    # removes unused architectures.
    find "$APP_PATH" -name '*.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
    do
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
    echo "Executable is $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"

    strip_invalid_archs "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
    done
    ```
