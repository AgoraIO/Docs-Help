If you receive an error code `600005` or `100004 "service not enable", "messages": "region":"sg"` an error similar to , it means that you have not enabled the corresponding whiteboard supporting service in the service area. If you need to use PPT, DOC, PDF and other courseware in the classroom, you need to enable the interactive whiteboard supporting service to enable and configure the document-to-webpage, document-to-picture, and screenshot services for Smart Classroom.

###What is the limit on the upload size of courseware?
- The courseware size cannot exceed 100M.
- The actual transcoding time is affected by the size of the courseware, the size of the courseware, the number of animations included in the courseware, the resolution of the visible pictures included, the number of pages of the courseware, and the transcoding queue. The higher the resolution of the included image, the slower the conversion. The number of pages is preferably within 50 pages, and conversion timeout may occur if more than 100 pages.

###What are the reasons for courseware upload failure?
- Supported file formats include: PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, PDF, MP3, MP4, PNG, JPG, GIF.
- There should be no special symbols in the courseware name, it is best to only contain Chinese, English and numbers; //TODO is best to list unsupported special symbols
- The courseware edited with WPS software may fail to upload or transcode. Soundnet recommends that you save such courseware in PPTX or PDF format and try to upload again.
