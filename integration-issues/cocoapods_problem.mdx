## pod: command not found

**Issue description** 

In Terminal, after running `pod init` under the root directory of your project, the Terminal prompts `pod: command not found`.

**Reason** 

CocoaPods is not installed.

**Solution**

See the following steps to solve the issue:

1. Run `sudo gem install cocoapods` and input the admin password to install CocoaPods.
2. After CocoaPods is successfully installed, go to the root directory of your project and run `pod init` again to generate a `Podfile` under your project folder.

 <div class="alert note">If you run <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>  and encounter authority issues such as <code>You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.3.0 directory</code> , Agora recommends that you run <code>sudo gem install -n /usr/bin cocoapods</code>  to install CocoaPods.</div>

## Cannot install the latest Agora SDK

**Issue description**

When you install the Agora SDK, you might encounter the following issues:

- After entering `pod 'library_name'` in a Podfile and running `pod install` in Terminal, the Agora SDK that is installed is not the latest version.

- After entering `pod 'library_name', 'latest_version'` in a Podfile and running `pod install` in Terminal, the Terminal prompts error messages such as the following:

 ```shell
 [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "AgoraRtcEngine_iOS":
  In Podfile:
    AgoraRtcEngine_iOS (= 3.5.0)
None of your spec sources contain a spec satisfying the dependency: `AgoraRtcEngine_iOS (= 3.5.0)`.
```

**Reason** 

The local CocoaPods repository is not updated.

**Solution**

See the following steps to solve the issue:

1. Run `pod repo update` in Terminal to update the local CocoaPods repository.
2. Run `pod install` again to install the latest version of the Agora SDK.
