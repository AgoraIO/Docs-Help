You can call the [`stop`](/cloud-recording/reference/restful-api#stop) method to leave the channel and stop recording.

Agora Cloud Recording automatically stops recording and leaves the channel when there is no user in the recording channel after a time period (30 seconds by default). You can set this timeout interval by the `maxIdleTime` parameter when you start the recording.
