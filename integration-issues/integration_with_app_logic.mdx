Flexible Classroom enables real-time engagement in classrooms but does not provide user management system and class scheduling system. If you already have a user management system and class scheduling system, refer to the following picture to connect Flexible Classroom with your own systems.

You need to implement the following business logic:

- Deploy an RTM Token generator on your server, and generate an RTM Token with parameters including the Agora App ID, App Certificate, and user ID. For details, see [Generate an RTM Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm?platform=All%20Platforms).
- Design a RESTful API for the following three purposes:
   - Check whether the user logging into the app exists in your user management system.
   - Get the user's personal information and class schedule.
   - Get the RTM token generated by the RTM Token Generator.

After the client gets the user ID, class ID, and RTM token, refer to the [quickstart guide](/en/agora-class/agora_class_quickstart_web) to call the `launch` method in the Agora Classroom SDK and pass in the user ID, class ID, and RTM token to the SDK to join a flexible classroom.

<div class="alert note"><li>Please ensure that the user ID and class ID are globally unique.</li><li>When the first user joins the classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom. The classroom is destroyed one hour after the last user leaves the classroom. Agora does not store any of your business data.</li></div>
