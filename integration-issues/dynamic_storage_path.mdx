When configuring the recording file storage path in the Acoustics console through fileNamePrefixthe field , you can use built-in variables to specify a dynamic path for storing recording files. When recording starts, variables are replaced with real values. The following two types of variables are currently supported:

| type           | variable                                           | illustrate                                                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fixed variable | `${appId}`                                         | App ID                                                                                        |
|                | `${roomUuid}`                                      | The Uuid of the class to be recorded                                                          |
| date variable  | `${yyyy}`                                          | Year                                                                                          |
|                | `${MM}`                                            | moon                                                                                          |
|                | `${dd}`                                            | day                                                                                           |
|                | `${yyyyMMdd}`, `${yyyyMM}`, `${yyyy-dd}`,`${MM_dd}`| Date variables can be combined, such as year-month-day, year-month, year-day, month_day, etc. |

For example, you set `fileNamePrefix` the field as follows:

```json
"fileNamePrefix": [
  "scenario",
  "recording",
  "${appId}",
  "${yyyyMM}",
  "${roomUuid}"
]
```
The recording storage path is `/scenario/recording/xxxxxxxxx/202107/demo/xxxxxxx_demo_0.mp4`.
