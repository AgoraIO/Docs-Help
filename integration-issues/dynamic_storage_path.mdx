When configuring the recording file storage path in the Console through the `fileNamePrefix` field,
you can use built-in variables to specify a dynamic path for storing recording files.
When the recording starts, variables are replaced with real values. The following two types of variables are currently supported:

| Type           | Variable                                           | Description                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Fixed variable | `${appId}`                                         | App ID                                |
|                | `${roomUuid}`                                      | The `uuid` of the class to be recorded|
| Date variable  | `${yyyy}`                                          | Year                                  |
|                | `${MM}`                                            | Month                                 |
|                | `${dd}`                                            | Day                                   |
|                | `${yyyyMMdd}`, `${yyyyMM}`, `${yyyy-dd}`,`${MM_dd}`| Date variables can be combined, such as year-month-day, year-month, year-day, month-day, and so on. |

For example, you set the `fileNamePrefix` field as follows:

```json
"fileNamePrefix": [
  "scenario",
  "recording",
  "${appId}",
  "${yyyyMM}",
  "${roomUuid}"
]
```
The recording storage path is `/scenario/recording/xxxxxxxxx/202107/demo/xxxxxxx_demo_0.mp4`.
