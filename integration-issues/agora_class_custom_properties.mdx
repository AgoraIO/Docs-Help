Flexible Classroom supports custom user properties and classroom properties. The property consists of a property name and a property value. Each property name has only one property value.

You can modify the value of a custom user or classroom property through full modification or path modification:

Suppose the current custom user or classroom property is as follows:

```json
{"key1":
   {"subkey1":"a",
    "subkey2":"b"
   },
 "key2":
   {"subkey3":"c",
    "subkey4":"d"
   }
}
```

There are several scenarios:

- If you want to capitalize all values of `subkey`, you can pass the following JSON array when calling the API through full modification:

   ```json
   {"key1":
      {"subkey1":"A",
       "subkey2":"B"
      },
    "key2":
      {"subkey3":"C",
       "subkey4":"D"
      }
   }
   ```

- If you only want to capitalize the value in `subkey1`, changing `a` into `A`, for example, you can pass `{"key1.subkey1":"A"}` when calling the API through path modification.

- If you want to add `subkey5` with the value of `E` to `key1`, you can pass `{"key1.subkey5":"E"}` when calling the API. The properties after modification are:

   ```json
   {"key1":
      {"subkey1":"A",
       "subkey2":"B",
       "subkey5":"E"
      },
    "key2":
      {"subkey3":"C",
       "subkey4":"D"
      }
   }
   ```

   Please note that if you pass `{"key1": {"subkey5": "E"} }`, all the original properties are overwritten.

- You can add multiple properties once. For example, pass `{"key1.subkey5":"E", "key2.subkey6":"F"}`. The properties after modification are:

   ```json
   {"key1":
      {"subkey1":"A",
       "subkey2":"B",
       "subkey5":"E"
      },
    "key2":
      {"subkey3":"C",
       "subkey4":"D",
       "subkey6":"F"
      }
   }
   ```
