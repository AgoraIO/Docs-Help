The Agora Signaling SDK does not have a limit on the number of concurrent online users. However, Agora has the following recommendations on the maximum number of channel messages per second for a single channel:

| Concurrent online users in a single channel | Number of channel messages per second |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| &lt; 1,000                                  | &lt; 200                              |
| &ge; 1,000 and &lt; 10,000                  | &lt; 100                              |
| &ge; 10,000                                 | &lt; 30                               |

<Admonition type="info">
- If the number of messages per second exceeds the recommended values, latency can increase significantly and may also cause the following issues:
  - The user cannot send or receive messages.
  - The user always stays in the RECONNECTING state or keeps switching between the CONNECTED state and the RECONNECTING state. For other users, the current user may appear offline.
- Agora provides a customized service to increase the number of messages per second without affecting latency or stability. Contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) for more information.
