You can monitor the status of cloud recording and cloud transcoding services using two methods:

- **Query method:** Actively request service status
- **Message notification service:** Receive automatic status updates

Each method has different advantages and use cases.

## Query method

Call the `query` method regularly to check service status. See the documentation for [querying cloud recording status](/cloud-recording/reference/restful-api#query) or [querying cloud transcoding status](/cloud-transcoding/rest-api/query).

### Advantages
- **High reliability:** You actively request status information
- **Guaranteed response:** Direct API calls provide immediate feedback

### Disadvantages
- **Limited information:** Provides basic status details only
- **Rate limits:** Subject to queries per second (QPS) restrictions
- **Less real-time:** Manual polling introduces delays

**When to use:** Choose this method when you need reliable, on-demand status information.

## Message notification service

Configure an HTTPS server to receive automatic event notifications. See the documentation for [cloud recording notifications](/cloud-recording/reference/rest-api-overview) or [cloud transcoding notifications](/cloud-transcoding/reference/webhooks/receive-ncs-events).

### Advantages
- **Real-time updates:** Receive notifications as events occur
- **Comprehensive information:** Detailed event data included

### Disadvantages
- **Potential message loss:** Passive reception may miss notifications
- **Duplicate messages:** Retry logic may send duplicate notifications
- **No ordering guarantee:** Messages may arrive out of sequence

### Requirements
- HTTPS server to receive notifications
- Message deduplication logic
- Error handling for missed messages

**When to use:** Choose this method when you need immediate notifications of service events.

## Important considerations

The message notification service should supplement, not replace, your core monitoring logic. 

- **Don't rely solely on notifications** for critical business processes
- **Implement both methods** for comprehensive monitoring
- [**Contact support**](mailto:support@agora.io) to enable redundant messaging if your application requires high reliability

Even with redundant messaging enabled, Agora cannot guarantee 100% message delivery.

## Best practice

For most applications, use the query method as your primary monitoring solution, with message notifications providing additional real-time awareness.
