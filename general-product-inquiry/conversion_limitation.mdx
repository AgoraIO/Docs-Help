Agora Interactive Whiteboard provides the dynamic file conversion function for converting PPTX files edited with Microsoft PowerPoint to HTML web pages. The generated files preserve animations present in the source files.

However, this function is not available for certain objects, formats, and effects in PPTX files. These objects, formats, or effects either disappear or display incorrectly in the converted files.

This page lists the PowerPoint features that are not supported or not well supported by the dynamic file conversion function. To achieve the best results, Agora recommends that you keep these limitations in mind when preparing your PPTX files intended for later conversion.
