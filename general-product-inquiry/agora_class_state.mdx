## Change the classroom state

In the Flexible Classroom client, you can specify the starting time and duration of a classroom by calling `launch` to set the following parameters:

- `startTime`: The starting time of the class in Unix format (ms), subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who joins the classroom.
- `duration`: The duration (s) of the class, subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who joins the classroom.

The state of the classroom is automatically started at the specified start time and automatically ended after the specified duration elapses.

In addition, you can change the classroom state by calling the [RESTful API](./agora_class_restful_api?platform=Android#set-the-classroom-state).
