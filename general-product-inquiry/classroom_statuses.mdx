### Classroom status switch

In the Smart Classroom client, when calling `launch` the method specify the class start time and duration through the following parameters, and set the switching of the class state:

- `startTime`: Set the class start time (in milliseconds), which is subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who enters the class.
- `duration`: Set the class duration (in seconds), which is subject to the parameter passed in by the first user who enters the class.
- `closeDelay`: Delay time (seconds), subject to the parameter passed in when creating the room, the default is 10 minutes.
The class will automatically start at the specified start time, and end automatically after the sum of the class duration and the procrastination time. Teachers can also start and end classes manually.

In addition, you can also switch the class status by setting the class status RESTful API.
