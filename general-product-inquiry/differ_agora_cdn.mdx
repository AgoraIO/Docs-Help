Most CDN + RTMP technologies for live streaming allow users to watch the live steaming in a web browser, which lowers the audience's threshold.
Agora provides a solution for SD-RTNâ„¢, host, and audience to have the same real-time communication quality as an individual line with:

- Private voice and video coding
- Private transport protocol
- Private node deployment
- Private transmission algorithms

See the following table for details:

| Feature                     | CDN + RTMP        | Agora Live Interactive Streaming                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Video Encoding and Decoding | H.264             | Private                                                                                                             |
